In this section, we report on our experiments and findings using supervised fine-tuning (Section 3.1), as well as initial and iterative reward modeling (Section 3.2.2) and RLHF (Section 3.2.3). We also share a new technique, Ghost Attention (GAtt), which we find helps control dialogue flow over multiple turns (Section 3.3). See Section 4.2 for safety evaluations on fine-tuned models.\n",

    "    Others have found that helpfulness and safety sometimes trade off (Bai et al., 2022a), which can make it challenging for a single reward model to perform well on both.

Note that a binary human preference comparison contains 2 responses (chosen and rejected) sharing the same prompt (and previous dialogue). Each example consists of a prompt (including previous dialogue if available) and a response, which is the input of the reward model.

    "    Training Objectives. To train the reward model, we convert our collected pairwise human preference data into a binary ranking label format (i.e., chosen & rejected) and enforce the chosen response to have a higher score than its counterpart.

    "    Built on top of this binary ranking loss, we further modify it separately for better helpfulness and safety reward models as follows. Given that our preference ratings is decomposed as a scale of four points (e.g., significantly better), as presented in Section 3.2.1, it can be useful to leverage this information to explicitly teach the reward model to assign more discrepant scores to the generations that have more differences. To do so, we further add a margin component in the loss:\n",
