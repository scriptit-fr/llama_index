Deleting entities by primary key is much faster and lighter than deleting them by complex boolean expressions. This is because Milvus executes queries first when deleting data by complex boolean expressions.\\nDeleted entities can still be retrieved immediately after the deletion if the consistency level is set lower than Strong.\\nEntities deleted beyond the pre-specified span of time for Time Travel cannot be retrieved again.\\nFrequent deletion operations will impact the system performance.\\nBefore deleting entities by comlpex boolean expressions, make sure the collection has been loaded.\\nDeleting entities by complex boolean expressions is not an atomic operation.
